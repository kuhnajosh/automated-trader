	Trying to fix an error for creating a class name, I am not sure if we need to design the
	class within the same scope as the the main method. The CoinHandler class is coming up with 
	This:  btc_handler = CoinHandler(product_id='BTC-USD')
				NameError: name 'CoinHandler' is not defined
	Attempting to fix it right now.

	Fixed it, all methods and classes need to be before the main method call

	Having an issue with the multithreading. When running the script, it seems that the first thread
	that is called is the only one that is run. The infinite loop seems to block out the rest of the
	threads. The issue may be with the infinite loop of the public client. This prevents any other
	thread being run, even if the thread doesn't contain a call to the public client ticker.
